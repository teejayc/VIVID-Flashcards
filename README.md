##Problem Background

Learning new vocabularies helps us to improve our reading, writing, and communication skills and lead us to succeed in academic, social, and work environment. One of the best ways to memorize new vocabularies is using flashcards.

However, the way we create, organize, and study flashcards can have a huge impact on the effectivity and  efficiency of learning. Making flashcards merely with words after words can demotivate the user and has low effectivity on memorizing. It is also very inefficient regarding time spent and studying to create decks of cards ignoring the vocabularies’ relativeness and difficulty. We might need helps from experienced people on the subject. Furthermore,  blindly flipping through a deck of cards does not guarantee we memorize each of the vocabularies with the same level.

##Solution

To improve the effectivity and efficiency of learning vocabularies, I have decided to make a flashcards mobile application that a user can customize the cards with images, organize and share with other users, and do the quiz that reflects the user’s learning pattern. Adding image attribute on the top of word and definition will increase the effectivity on memorizing by visualization and association. The organizing feature gives flexibility on creating the user’s customized decks of cards. Sharing decks enables beginners of a subject to get help from experienced by downloading his/her decks which are made thoroughly considering relatives and difficulty. Finally, the quiz that reflects the user’s learning pattern will make sure he/she memorize all the vocabularies to the same level effectively.

##Goal

The ultimate goal of the project is building an Android flashcards mobile application that increases the effectivity and efficiency of learning vocabularies by adding flexibility in creating and organizing cards, sharing decks, and pattern learning quizzes.

##Features - Overview

The main features of the application are having the user to customize the cards with images, organizing decks of cards, sharing, and pattern learning quizzes.

###Cards Customization and Deck Organization

The cards customization with image feature will have the user add any image to a card that he or she can associate with the vocabulary.  The user can either load in the image by taking a picture or from his or her own storage.

Deck organization feature enables the user to organize cards considering relativeness and difficulty. The user can copy and move around the cards between decks.

###Random Quiz Mode

The random quiz mode will keep track of the learning pattern of the user. Each time the user go through a deck of cards, for each card, he/she will be asked if  he/she still remembers the vocabulary. If the user has forgotten the vocabulary, the frequency of the vocabulary appears on the random quiz will go up. It will make sure the user memorize all the cards in the deck.

###Card Deck Sharing

The application will let the users share their customized decks of cards to get or give help to each other. The users will be given points according to the number of decks downloaded by other users as the incentive. Then, he or she can use the points to download other decks of cards. This system will encourage users to customize decks and cards accordingly based on their knowledge. It will also increase the knowledge level and professionality of decks in the application database.

##Hardware Requirements

The application requires the device between API 16 to API 23.

##Software Requirements

The application runs on Android.
